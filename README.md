# DARec
Unofficial Pytorch implementation of DARec: Deep Domain Adaptation for Cross-Domain Recommendation via Transferring Rating Patterns

1. Run Data_Preprocessing.py and set processed=False to generate rating matrix
2. Run Train_AutoRec.py to get pretrained Autorec
3. Run Train_DArec.py to get results

The .zip file contains the author's code they sent to me, which is implemented by tensorflow.
